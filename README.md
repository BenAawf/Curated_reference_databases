# Curated_reference_databases

This repository contains the complete description of how we produced the curated reference databases for the studies in Evolutionary and Environmental Genomics Group (@EvoHull)

Currently, we have completed the curated reference databases of mitochondrial __12S__ and __Cytb__ including European freshwater fish, amphibians, birds, reptiles and mammals.

##Contents

__The contributors for each database as below:__

__Cytb__

- European freshwater fish by Christoph Hahn GiHub ID ([chrishah](https://github.com/chrishah))


__12S__
- European freshwater fish by Jianlong Li (GiHub ID: JoeJianlongLi https://github.com/JoeJianlongLi) and Christoph Hahn

- amphibians by Lynsey R. Harper (GiHub ID: lrharper1 https://github.com/lrharper1) 
- birds
- reptiles 
- mammals 


Work your way through the notebooks in the individual directories in the following order:
